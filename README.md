This extension exposes the abstract syntax tree generated by PHP 7.

Installation
------------

**On Windows**: Download a [prebuilt Windows DLL](http://windows.php.net/downloads/pecl/snaps/ast/)
and move it into the `ext/` directory of your PHP instalation. Furthermore add
`extension=php_ast.dll` to your `php.ini` file.

**On Unix**: Compile and install the extension as follows.

```sh
phpize
./configure
make
sudo make install
```

Additionally add `extension=ast.so` to your `php.ini` file.

API overview
------------

Defines:

 * `ast\Node` class
 * `ast\Node\Decl` class
 * `ast\AST_*` kind constants (mirroring `zend_ast.h`)
 * `ast\flags\*` flags
 * `ast\parse_file(string $filename, int $version)`
 * `ast\parse_code(string $code, int $version [, string $filename = "string code"])`
 * `ast\get_kind_name(int $kind)`
 * `ast\kind_uses_flags(int $kind)`

Usage
-----

Code can be parsed using either `ast\parse_code()`, which accepts a code string, or
`ast\parse_file()`, which accepts a file path. Additionally both functions require a `$version`
argument to ensure forward-compatibility. The current version is 40.

```php
$ast = ast\parse_code('<?php ...', $version=40);
// or
$ast = ast\parse_file('file.php', $version=40);
```

The abstract syntax tree returned by these functions consists of `ast\Node` objects.
`ast\Node` is declared as follows:

```php
namespace ast;
class Node {
    public $kind;
    public $flags;
    public $lineno;
    public $children;
}
```

The `kind` property specified the type of the node. It is an integral value, which corresponds to
one of the `ast\AST_*` constants, for example `ast\AST_STMT_LIST`. You can retrieve the string name
of an integral kind by passing it to `ast\get_kind_name()`.

The `flags` property contains node specific flags. It is always defined, but for most nodes it is
always zero. `ast\kind_uses_flags()` can be used to determine whether a certain kind has a
meaningful flags value. Which nodes use which flags is explained in the "Flags" section below.

The `lineno` property specifies the *starting* line number of the node.

The `children` property contains an array of child-nodes. These children can be either other
`ast\Node` objects or plain values. The meaning of the children is node-specific and should be
deduced from context or by looking at the [parser definition][parser].

Function and class declarations use `ast\Node\Decl` objects instead, which specify a number of
additional properties:

```php
namespace ast\Node;
use ast\Node;

class Decl extends Node {
    public $endLineno;
    public $name;
    public $docComment;
}
```

`endLineno` provides the end line number of the declaration, `name` contains the name of the
function or class (can be `null` for anonymous classes) and `docComment` contains the preceding
doc comment or `null` if no doc comment was used.

Simple usage example:

```php
<?php

$code = <<<'EOC'
<?php
$var = 42;
EOC;

var_dump(ast\parse_code($code, $version=40));

// Output:
object(ast\Node)#1 (4) {
  ["kind"]=>
  int(133)
  ["flags"]=>
  int(0)
  ["lineno"]=>
  int(1)
  ["children"]=>
  array(1) {
    [0]=>
    object(ast\Node)#2 (4) {
      ["kind"]=>
      int(517)
      ["flags"]=>
      int(0)
      ["lineno"]=>
      int(2)
      ["children"]=>
      array(2) {
        ["var"]=>
        object(ast\Node)#3 (4) {
          ["kind"]=>
          int(256)
          ["flags"]=>
          int(0)
          ["lineno"]=>
          int(2)
          ["children"]=>
          array(1) {
            ["name"]=>
            string(3) "var"
          }
        }
        ["expr"]=>
        int(42)
      }
    }
  }
}
```

The [`util.php`][util] file defines an `ast_dump()` function, which can be used to create a more
compact and human-readable dump of the AST structure:

```php
<?php

require 'path/to/util.php';

$code = <<<'EOC'
<?php
$var = 42;
EOC;

echo ast_dump(ast\parse_code($code, $version=40)), "\n";

// Output:
AST_STMT_LIST
    0: AST_ASSIGN
        var: AST_VAR
            name: "var"
        expr: 42
```

To additionally show line numbers pass the `AST_DUMP_LINENOS` option as the second argument to
`ast_dump()`.

A more substantial AST dump can be found [in the tests][test_dump].

Flags
-----

This section lists which flags are used by which AST node kinds. The "combinable" flags can be
combined using bitwise or and should be checked by using `$ast->flags & ast\flags\FOO`. The
"exclusive" flags are used standalone and should be checked using `$ast->flags === ast\flags\BAR`.

Version changelog
-----------------

### 50 (in development)

* `ast\Node\Decl` nodes are no longer generated. AST kinds `AST_FUNCTION`, `AST_METHOD`,
  `AST_CLOSURE` and `AST_CLASS` now also use the normal `ast\Node` class. The `name` and
  `docComment` properties are now represented as children. The `endLineno` is still represented as
  an (undeclared) property.
* An integer `__declId` has been added to declaration nodes of kind `AST_FUNCTION`, `AST_METHOD`,
  `AST_CLOSURE` and `AST_CLASS`. The `__declId` uniquely identifies a declaration within the parsed
  code and will remain the same if the code is parsed again. This is useful to distinguish closures
  declared on the same line, or multiple conditional declarations using the same name. The ID is not
  unique across different codes/files.
* `\ast\parse_file` will now consistently return an empty statement list (similar to
  `\ast\parse_code`) if it is was passed a zero-byte file. Previously, it would return `null`.

### 45 (in development)

This version normalizes the AST to PHP 7.2 format.

* An `object` type annotation now returns an `AST_TYPE` with `TYPE_OBJECT` flag, rather than
  treating `object` as a class name.

### 40 (current)

Supported since 2017-01-18.

* `AST_COALESCE` is now represented as an `AST_BINARY_OP` with flag `BINARY_COALESCE`.
* For `AST_NAME` nodes with `NAME_FQ` the leading backslash is now dropped if syntax like
  `('\bar')()` is used. Previously this would return the name as `'\bar'`, while a normal `\bar()`
  call would return it as `'bar'`. Now always the latter form is used.
* `null` elements are now stripped from `AST_STMT_LIST`. Previously these could be caused by nop
  statements (`;`).
* Type hints `int`, `float`, `string`, `bool`, `void` and `iterable` will now be represented as
  `AST_TYPE` nodes with a respective flag.
* Many `stmts` children could previously hold one of `null`, a single node or an `AST_STMT_LIST`.
  These will now be normalized to always use an `AST_STMT_LIST`. A `null` is only allowed if it is
  semantically meaningful, e.g. in the case of `declare(ticks=1);` vs `declare(ticks=1) {}`.

### 35 (supported)

Supported since 2016-08-04.

This version normalizes the AST to PHP 7.1 format.

* The `class` node of `AST_CATCH` is now always represented as an `AST_NAME_LIST`. In lower
  versions: On PHP 7.0 it will always be an `AST_NAME`. In PHP 7.1 it will be an `AST_NAME` if
  there is only a single class and `AST_NAME_LIST` otherwise.
* `list()` destructuring is now always represented as an `AST_ARRAY` with `ARRAY_SYNTAX_LIST` flag.
  In lower versions: On PHP 7.0 it will always be an `AST_LIST`. In PHP 7.1 it will be an
  `AST_ARRAY` if `list()` is used with keys. In PHP 7.1 destructuring using `[]` will always be
  represented using `AST_ARRAY`, independently of the version.

### 30 (deprecated)

Supported since 2015-03-10. Deprecated since 2017-06-25.

* Use string names for child nodes of kinds with fixed length.

### 20 (removed)

Supported since 2015-12-14. Deprecated since 2016-08-04. Removed since 2017-01-18.

* `AST_GREATER`, `AST_GREATER_EQUAL`, `AST_OR`, `AST_AND` nodes are now represented using
  `AST_BINARY_OP` with flags `BINARY_IS_GREATER`, `BINARY_IS_GREATER_OR_EQUAL`, `BINARY_BOOL_OR`
  and `BINARY_BOOL_AND`.
* `AST_SILENCE`, `AST_UNARY_MINUS` and `AST_UNARY_PLUS` nodes are now represented using
  `AST_UNARY_OP` with flags `UNARY_SILENCE`, `UNARY_MINUS` and `UNARY_PLUS`
* `AST_ASSIGN_OP` now uses `BINARY_*` flags instead of separate `ASSIGN_*` flags.
* `AST_STATIC` and `AST_CATCH` now use an `AST_VAR` node for the static/catch variable. Previously
  it was a simple string containing the name.
* Nested `AST_STMT_LIST`s are now flattened out.

### 15 (removed)

Supported since 2015-10-21. Deprecated since 2016-04-30. Removed since 2016-08-04.

* In line with an upstream change, the `docComment` property on `AST_PROP_DECL` has been moved to
  `AST_PROP_ELEM`. This means that each property in one property declaration can have its own
  doc comment.

### 10 (removed)

Initial. Removed since 2016-08-04.

Differences to PHP-Parser
-------------------------

Next to php-ast I also maintain the [PHP-Parser][php-parser] library, which has some overlap with
this extension. This section summarizes the main differences between php-ast and PHP-Parser so you
may decide which is preferable for your use-case.

The primary difference is that php-ast is a PHP extension (written in C) which exports the AST
internally used by PHP 7. PHP-Parser on the other hand is library written in PHP. This has a number
of consequences:

 * php-ast is significantly faster than PHP-Parser, because the AST construction is implemented in
   C.
 * php-ast needs to be installed as an extension, on Linux either by compiling it manually or
   retrieving it from a package manager, on Windows by loading a DLL. PHP-Parser is installed as a
   Composer dependency.
 * php-ast only runs on PHP >= 7.0, as prior versions did not use an internal AST. PHP-Parser
   supports PHP >= 5.4.
 * php-ast may only parse code that is syntactically valid on the version of PHP it runs on. This
   means that it's not possible to parse code using features of newer versions (e.g. PHP 7.1 code
   while running on PHP 7.0). Similarly, it is not possible to parse code that is no longer
   syntactically valid on the used version (e.g. some PHP 5 code may no longer be parsed -- however
   most code will work). PHP-Parser supports parsing both newer and older (up to PHP 5.2) versions.
 * php-ast only provides the starting line number (and for declarations the ending line number) of
   nodes, because this is the only part that PHP itself stores. PHP-Parser provides precise file
   offsets.

There are a number of differences in the AST representation and available support code:

 * The PHP-Parser library uses a separate class for every node type, with child nodes stored as
   type-annotated properties. php-ast uses one class for everything, with children stored as
   arrays. The former approach is friendlier to developers because it has very good IDE integration.
   The php-ast extension does not use separate classes, because registering hundreds of classes was
   judged a no-go for a bundled extension.
 * The PHP-Parser library contains various support code for working with the AST, while php-ast only
   handles AST construction. The reason for this is that implementing this support code in C is
   extremely complicated and there is little other benefit to implementing it in C. The main
   components that PHP-Parser offers that may be of interest are:
    * Node dumper (human readable representation): While the php-ast extension does not directly
      implement this, a `ast_dump` function is provided in the `util.php` file.
    * Pretty printer (converting the AST back to PHP code): This is not provided natively, but the
      [php-ast-reverter][php-ast-reverter] package implements this functionality.
    * Name resolution (resolving namespace prefixes and aliases): There is currently no standalone
      package for this.
    * AST traversation / visitation: There is currently no standalone package for this either, but
      implementing a recursive AST walk is easy.
